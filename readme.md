All the custom nlp models built for the bot can be placed in this folder and can be accessed in the nlp_commands.py file.


Note: You need to generate the onetime.txt file before you initiate the bot. To generate the onetime.txt file, navigate to the root folder and use the command below,

```sh
python3 nlp/nlp_solutions/onetime_run_file.py
```
